Question:

The following code computes the [integer] square root of a number.  If the number is not a perfect square (there is no integer square root), then it returns -1.  It does this by trying increasingly large numbers until it finds the right value (or is too high).  What is its runtime?

int sqrt(int n) {
    for(int guess = 1; guess * guess <= n; guess++) {
        if(guess * guess == n) {
            return guess;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

Answer:

O(sqrt(n))
